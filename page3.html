<h1>What can we do to stop losing our biodiversity?</h1>
<p>Since we can reverse what has already been done, we could always start looking for ways to right the wrongs. People always jump to solutions without first fully analysing the situation, and it ends up making the problem better on for a little while. Obviously, most people would gravitate towards the idea of planting more trees or reducing pollution, but they don't actually consider how difficult it is to accomplish these tasks. If a tree is planted, it takes 10-15 years to even start making a difference</p>
