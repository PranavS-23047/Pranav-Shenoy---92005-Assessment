<h1>What can we do to stop losing our biodiversity?</h1>
<p>Since we can reverse what has already been done, we could always start looking for ways
    to right the wrongs. People always jump to solutions without first fully analysing the
    situation, and it ends up making the problem better on for a little while. Obviously,
    most people would gravitate towards the idea of planting more trees or reducing pollution,
    but they don't actually consider how difficult it is to accomplish these tasks. If a tree
    is planted, it takes 10-15 years to even start making a difference and whatever happens in
    between is forgotten about. It is the same story for reducing pollution by picking up litter.
    It only works short term because people would eventually get sick and tired of picking up
    rubbish and would stop doing it all together. Both these ideas of planting trees and picking
    up rubbish are good and would work for short periods of time but to full restore our biodiversity
    we need a good long term solution. For starters, we could protect what we have right now, restore
    habitats bits at a time, be aware of invasive species/pests, nullify climate change effects and
    get community help. These sorts of big ideas are what will carry our hopes of restoring New Zealand's
    lost biodiversity.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 10px;">A big problem is losing our biodiversity and that is the primary/root cause of biodiversity loss. Instead of directly preventing further loss, a more realistic plan of action should be to protect and preserve what we have. This means that we have to take extra care of any current ecosystems and habitats that are thriving by not interfering. </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 10px;">The second of the two main problems is invasive species. Invasive species are organisms that are not endemic to New Zealand. These are animals and plants that have been introduced over a period of time. Since the endemic species of New Zealand hadn't been around the new introduced species, they were extremely prone to new predators and diseases. Even though not all introduced species are invasive, it still did a number on New Zealand's biodiversity.</p>
