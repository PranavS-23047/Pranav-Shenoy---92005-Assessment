<h1>What can we do to stop losing our biodiversity?</h1>
<p>Since we can reverse what has already been done, we could always start looking for ways
    to right the wrongs. People always jump to solutions without first fully analysing the
    situation, and it ends up making the problem better on for a little while. Obviously,
    most people would gravitate towards the idea of planting more trees or reducing pollution,
    but they don't actually consider how difficult it is to accomplish these tasks. If a tree
    is planted, it takes 10-15 years to even start making a difference and whatever happens in
    between is forgotten about. It is the same story for reducing pollution by picking up litter.
    It only works short term because people would eventually get sick and tired of picking up
    rubbish and would stop doing it all together. Both these ideas of planting trees and picking
    up rubbish are good and would work for short periods of time but to full restore our biodiversity
    we need a good long term solution. For starters, we could protect what we have right now, restore
    habitats bits at a time, be aware of invasive species/pests, nullify climate change effects and
    get community help. These sorts of big ideas are what will carry our hopes of restoring New Zealand's
    lost biodiversity.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 10px;">A big problem is losing our biodiversity and that is the primary/root cause of biodiversity loss. Instead of directly preventing further loss, a more realistic plan of action should be to protect and preserve what we have. This means that we have to take extra care of any current ecosystems and habitats that are thriving by not interfering. A good start would be to prohibit access to certain areas to protect the wildlife and building on that, recycling or choosing more sustainable options could also go a long way.</p>

  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;" class="squareinfo">
  <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Bringing back what we have lost can also help New Zealand's biodiversity crisis. If we have lost so much replacing it would be a good solution. Since we can't randomly choose to put a tree here or there or magically grow a population we could slowly start to make those kinds of changes. For example in places which have gone through deforestation, all the old trees could be removed and replanted then all the native wildlife could go back to living in a safe environment. </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Invasive species and pests are animals and plants that are harmful to the native species of New Zealand. For example animals like possums hunt native birds and eat their eggs meaning that they can't grow their population and are then closer to extinction. A possible solution to this is something New Zealand have already started doing and that is setting up traps and poison.</p>
</div>

  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;" class="squareinfo">
  <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Climate change is one more serious issue that is affecting the loss of biodiversity in New Zealand. The sun is causing droughts, the rain is causing floods, sea levels a rising and there a so many more natural disasters occurring. As climate chang is directly related to greenhouse gas emissions a possible solution would be to get off fossil fuels and improving energy efficiency.</p>

      <img src="images/chelp.png" alt="Example Image" width="200">
  <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Lastly the best thing of all is to get everyone to play their part in making New Zealand better again. With more people volunteering to do beach clean-ups or getting more people to save species in the wild, the change we are desperately looking for would happen much sooner. As long as each person is ready to pick up after themselves, make small home improvements, recycle or do anything to reduce their carbon footprints, through natures course New Zealand's loss of biodiversity can be restored.</p>
