<h1>What is the main problem?</h1>
<p>There are many factors to consider when the term biodiversity loss is being used so there is no real main problem. In New Zealand specifically, we have faced a big on-land problem which was the introduction of invasive species, predators and herbivores. This has led to a decline in numbers for many indigenous species as well as extinction which includes plants and animals. One of the most recent animals to go extinct was the South Island K≈çkako which was officially declared extinct by the Department of Conservation in 2007 despite there still being ongoing reports and sightings. Another big problem revolves around the reduction of habitat quality and habitat loss. </p>
